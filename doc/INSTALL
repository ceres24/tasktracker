1) Installing Notes and dependencies

  # Go to the root storage folder for project

    cd /usr/local/

    sudo mkdir notes
  
  # This will ask you for a password, this is your login password.
  
  # Change permissions to user who will be doing the code update process via git.
  # Replace username below by your actual username.
  # Replace group by your actual group, Ex: PosixUsers, staff
  # Doing an ls -al in your home directory should provide you with your primary group
  
    sudo chown username notes
  
    sudo chgrp group notes
  
  # Download the code from the git repository.  The period at the end of git clone is required to install the code into the current directory.
  
    cd /usr/local/notes

    git clone git@agile.dipr.partners.org:notes.git .
    
    bundle install

2) Finalize the Installation

  # Initialize setup files

    cd /usr/local/notes/lib
    ruby initial_setup.rb

  # Run the Database Migrations

    cd /usr/local/notes
    rake db:create RAILS_ENV=development
    rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development

  # Seed the Database
